# m2m-dataPortal
Basic idea is to provide a relatively simple interface for distributing data from the M2M project.
Some of the value added features are:
* db (sqlite3) driven to avoid repeated crawling of the data directories
* support for a single markdown readme file (README.md) in each folder/directory
* breadcrumb indicator at top of page
